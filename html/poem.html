                            Woke up this morning and it seemed to me,<br>
                            That every night turns out to be<br>
                            A little bit more like Bukowski.<br>
                            And yeah, I know he's a preety good read.<br>
                            But God who'd want to be?<br>
                            God who'd want to be such an asshole?<br>
                            God who'd want to be?<br>

                        <p>
                            Well we sat at the edge of the river,<br>
                            The crowd screamed, "Sacrafice the liver!"<br>
                            If God takes life, he's an Indian giver.<br>
                            So tell me now why, you'll tell me never.<br>
                            Who would want to be?<br>
                            Who would want to be such a control freak?<br>
                            Well Who would want to be?<br>

                            Well take what you want from me. You deserve it all.<br>
                            Nine times out of ten our hearts just get dissolved.<br>
                            Well I want a better place or just a better way to fall.<br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But one time out of ten, everything is perfect for us all.<br>
                            Well I want a better place or just a better way to fall.<br>

                            I can't make it to your wedding, but I'm sure I'll be at your wake.<br>
                            You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in curcles that day,<br>
                            When you get to the point make sure that I'm still awake, OK?<br>
                        </p>
