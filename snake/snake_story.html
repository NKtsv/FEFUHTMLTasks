            <h2>Blockade</h2>
            <p class="text">
                At its roots, Snake borrows from a 1976 arcade game, 
                called Blockade. Distinctly similar to Snake, 
                the game was designed for two players and couldn’t be played alone. 
                In it, both the players would navigate their own snakes, 
                leaving a solid line behind them. 
                The line itself becomes a blockade for you, 
                and the player who lasts longer on the board, wins. 
                Trying to play this game alone would be impossible,
                since the second player’s snake would simply ram into a wall, 
                ending the session.

            <h2>The Snake is born</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Fast forwarding by a couple of decades, in 1997, 
                Nokia put Snake on a phone called the Nokia 6110. 
                This was the beginning of Snake in your pocket, the game almost went viral, 
                signalling a new era in mobile phone gaming. What started in 1997, 
                reached viral status in the year 2000, with the launch of the Nokia 3310. 
                One of the best selling mobile phones of all time, 
                the Nokia sold 126 million units of this device in that year. 
                Residing within the device, was Snake, 
                the game that quickly became a household name in India and the world alike.                
                But this wasn’t the Snake we then knew. 
                Snake 2, the game loaded on the original Nokia 3310, 
                gave the Snake an actual snake-like form, 
                while adding bonuses you could pick up while playing. 
                The playing field or the board, also became cyclical, 
                meaning you could go in through one side and appear from the other. 
                Lastly, mazes were added, to make the game even more challenging.

            <h2>Growing and Evolving Snake</h2>
            <p class="text">
                From thereon, Snake became an important part of mobile gaming history. 
                The game was addictive and appropriate for people of all ages. 
                It was like the Game of Life, but for the mobile phone user. 
                Nokia went on to evolve Snake, and some would argue, ruin it. 
                If you owned a Nokia 1600, you would remember Snake Xenzia, 
                which was similar to Snake 2, but meant for monochrome displays. 
                The first real improvement in graphics came with a game called Snake EX, 
                which kept all the key features of Snake 2, but with improved graphics. 
                You got a top-down view of a green snake eating bugs, while you navigate the thing around. 
                The snake could even open its mouth when eating now. Things were fine till this point, 
                when Nokia came up with its failed n-Gage platform. With it, 
                the company decided to continue making Snake a part of its game offerings. 
                However, many would argue that Snakes, the game meant for the n-Gage platform was the downfall of Snake.
                Made in 3D, you now got a third person view of the Snake, 
                following behind it at is it ate psychedelic looking bugs, 
                in a psychedelic world. While Snakes was still addictive, for many, 
                it just didn’t live up to what they were used to from the iconic game. 
                Nokia made a new version to this, later, called Snake Subsonic, 
                but that didn’t make much of a difference either.
